      <description>In the last few decades, neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. These artificial networks have demonstrated their effectiveness in a wide range of applications, from speech recognition and computer vision to automatic translation and user behavior prediction.
A neural network is a computational model composed of interconnected units called neurons, which work together to process and learn complex patterns from data.</description>

      <description>Introduction In recent years, advances in Deep Learning, and in particular in neural networks, have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. Thanks to their ability to learn autonomously from large amounts of data, neural networks have succeeded in pushing the limits of performance in a variety of tasks.
One of the areas in which neural networks have had a significant impact is image recognition and computer vision. By using architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), surprising results have been achieved in object classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.</description>

      <description>This post will present a code implemented in Python for the topology optimization method SIMP.
First, letâ€™s consider the next steps to make the algorithm:
Discretized the domain and initialize the design variables. Perform the finite element analysis. Calculate the sensitivity of the objective function with respect to the density of each element. Perform the optimality criteria. Compute the error of the density. Repeat steps 2 to 5 until the mass $M^*$ or the convergence of the error is achieved.</description>

      <title>SIMP Method for Topology Optimization</title>

      <description>This method has been shown to be used in a large number of problems, since it is computationally efficient and simple to implement. Unlike BESO ESO/BESO this method uses a soft-kill criterion, that is, the elements are not completely eliminated, they are only reduces the elastic modulus or one of the dimensional characteristics. This criterion is implemented since the complete removal of elements can result in theoretical difficulties.
The problem presented seeks to minimize the minimum compliance of the model.</description>

      <description>The ESO (evolutionary structural optimization) and BESO (bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization) methods are methods with hard-kill optimization criteria, that is, they can eliminate material and this causes the domain to be modified.
The ESO method consists of the simple concept of removing material that is inefficient. This is done by calculating the stresses in the entire model and eliminating the elements with low values.
Optimization by the level of stress For this, the stress level of each element is calculated and compared with criteria defined as rejection criteria.</description>

      <title>Approach to structural optimization.</title>

      <description>This post will talk about structural optimization from a more general point of view, with the aim of strengthening the bases for future applications.
To understand in a simple way the background of structural optimization it is a good idea to separate the two terms and take the definition of each. Optimization consists of doing things better and a structure can be understood as an assembly of material that has the purpose of supporting loading.</description>

      <description>In this post I will talk about the project which I will be working approximate one year. The project is about structural optimization using machine learning. The general objetive is design microstructures of hybrids materials using structural optimization.
With advances in the manufacturing technology of microstructures of materials, the interest has increased around material simulation and optimization. One idea that is had with the arrival of new technologies is the design and manufacture of microstructures for desired properties.</description>

      <description>This post is an installation&amp;rsquo;s guide for OneDriver on Ubuntu or Debian distributions.
Almost my entire life I have used a computer with Windows operating system, some mouth ago I decide to try Linux operating system, just for curiosity, so I made a dual boot in my laptop giving me the possibility to use Linux and Windows, I decided to make this because there are some programs which aren&amp;rsquo;t available on Linux.</description>
